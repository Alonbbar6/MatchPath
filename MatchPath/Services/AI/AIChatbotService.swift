            🪑 Finding Your Seat:

            To help you find your seat, I need to know your ticket information!

            General tips for finding seats at \(stadium.name):
            1️⃣ **Check your ticket** for:
               • Section number (e.g., 101, 201, 301)
               • Row letter or number
               • Seat number

            2️⃣ **Enter through recommended gate**
               • Your schedule shows the best gate for your section
               • Look for signs pointing to your section range

            3️⃣ **Follow the signs**
               • Sections 100-199: Lower Bowl
               • Sections 200-299: Middle Level
               • Sections 300-399: Upper Deck

            4️⃣ **Ask stadium staff (ushers)**
               • They're stationed at each level
               • Show them your ticket and they'll point the way

            💡 Tip: Take a photo of the nearest section marker when you leave your seat - makes it easier to find your way back!

        🧭 How to Get to Your Seat at \(stadium.name):

        **Your Recommended Route:**

        1️⃣ **Enter at: \(recommendedGate.name)**
           ✅ This gate is closest to your seating area
           ✅ Lower crowd levels expected

        2️⃣ **Once Inside:**
           • Look for directional signs showing section numbers
           • Stadium staff (ushers) wear uniforms - they can help!
           • Most sections are clearly marked with large numbers

        3️⃣ **General Layout:**
           Sections at \(stadium.name):
           • **100-level**: Lower Bowl (closest to field)
           • **200-level**: Middle Tier (great views)
           • **300-level**: Upper Deck (full stadium view)

        4️⃣ **Navigation Tips:**
           • Use escalators/stairs to reach your level
           • Follow concourse around until you see your section number
           • Ushers at each section entrance will check tickets
           • Seat numbers usually go from lowest (aisle) to highest

        📱 **Pro Tips:**
        • Download your ticket before entering (weak signal inside)
        • Take a photo of nearby landmarks when you leave your seat
        • Food/bathrooms are on the concourse behind seating areas
        • Allow 5-10 min to find your seat from the gate

        🗺️ **Need More Help?**
        Many stadiums have:
        • Interactive kiosks with maps
        • Mobile apps with seat finder features
        • Guest services desks on each level
